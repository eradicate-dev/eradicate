#' Cat removal and monitoring on San Nicolas Island
#'
#' A simulated example dataset of removal sampling and additional camera monitoring
#' on San Nicolas Island, California.  The data consist of the counts of cats removed
#' at each of 100 leg-hold traps spaced randomly on the island over 20 separate removal
#' (primary) periods. For each primary period, traps were set for 10 consecutive nights
#' (secondary period).

#' San_nic_open
#'
#' Simulated rabbit removal on San Nicolas Island
#'
#' A simulated example dataset of removal sampling of rabbits from an open population
#' on San Nicolas Island, California.  The data consist of the counts of rabbits removed
#' from each of 100 traps spaced randomly on the island over 8 separate removal
#' (primary) periods. For each primary period, traps were set for 4 consecutive nights
#' (secondary period).  Primary period trapping was undertaken every 3 months over a two year
#' period and hence, it would be unreasonable to expect the population to be closed. Hence,
#' these data require analysis with an open population removal model (i.e. `remMNO()`).

#' HogDeer
#'
#' Example camera trapping data set containing camera encounters of hog deer
#' (Axis porcinus).
#'
#' The dataset consists of distance sampling data from camera traps as well as data
#' on residence times in front of the camera (staying time) for each encounter.
#' Distance sampling data is used for estimating the effective sampling area of the
#' camera viewshed using \code{dist_func}. The effective camera viewshed area and staying
#' time data are required for use in the \code{REST} model. Distance bin numbers for
#' images of hog deer were derived from markers placed in the camera viewshed at
#' 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 m from the camera. The right truncation distance was set at 12.5 m.
