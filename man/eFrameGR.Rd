\title{eFrameGR}
\usage{
eFrameGR(y, siteCovs = NULL, obsCovs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{An MxJ matrix of the observed removal data, where M is the
number of sites and J is the maximum number of removal (primary)
periods per site. Each primary period can consist of k secondary
periods but this is not used here.}

\item{siteCovs}{A \code{data.frame} of covariates that vary at the
site level. This should have M rows and one column per covariate.}

\item{obsCovs}{A list of matrices or data.frames of variables varying within sites.
Each matrix or data.frame must be of dimension MxJ.}
}
\value{
a \code{eFrameGR} holding data containing the response and
 covariates required for removal models
}
\description{
\code{eFrameGR} creates an eFrameGR data object for use with generalized removal
models using the robust design where sampling occurs over a number of primary and
secondary periods.
